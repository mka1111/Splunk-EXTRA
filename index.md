Ah, now we’re talking about **how Splunk calculates storage usage** and why there’s often “padding” involved. Let’s break it down slowly and clearly.

---

## 🔹 1️⃣ Base storage in Splunk

Splunk stores **indexed data** in *buckets*. Each bucket contains:

1. **Raw data** → the original log events
2. **Indexes** → metadata to make searches fast

   * `tsidx` files (timestamps)
   * `blooms` (event lookup optimization)
3. **Other bookkeeping files** → manifest, summaries, etc.

So the total storage per event is **larger than the raw log size**.

---

## 🔹 2️⃣ Padding factor

Splunk adds a **padding factor** (sometimes called *index expansion*) to account for the extra indexing structures.

* Typical **expansion ratio**: **1.5x to 2x** the raw log size, depending on:

  * Event size
  * Number of fields extracted
  * Timestamp/host/source indexing
  * Compressed vs uncompressed logs

**Example:**

* Raw log = 100 MB
* After indexing, storage = 150–200 MB (depends on field extractions and indexing settings)

---

## 🔹 3️⃣ How Splunk calculates index size

1. Splunk tracks **bucket size on disk** in `$SPLUNK_DB/<index>/db/`.
2. The `rest` API or `| rest /services/data/indexes` gives you:

```spl
| rest /services/data/indexes
| table title totalEventCount currentDBSizeMB frozenTimePeriodInSecs
```

* `currentDBSizeMB` → actual size on disk (including padding)
* `totalEventCount` → number of events indexed
* `frozenTimePeriodInSecs` → retention policy

---

## 🔹 4️⃣ Estimating storage with padding

If you want to **estimate storage needs** for a new index:

```text
Estimated Storage = Raw Data Size × Expansion Factor
```

* Expansion Factor = 1.5–2.0 (typical)
* Add extra for **warm/cold buckets** if using replication in clustered environments

**Example:**

* Daily logs = 50 GB
* Splunk expansion = 1.8x
* Daily index storage = 50 × 1.8 ≈ 90 GB

If you have replication factor **2** in a cluster:

* Total storage = 90 × 2 = 180 GB per day

---

## 🔹 5️⃣ Check actual index size in Splunk

You can run this search to see **real disk usage** per index:

```spl
| rest /services/data/indexes
| table title currentDBSizeMB totalEventCount
| eval currentDBSizeGB = round(currentDBSizeMB/1024,2)
| sort -currentDBSizeGB
```

This gives a **true picture of the “padded” size** of your indexes.

---

✅ Summary:

* Splunk always stores more than raw logs because of indexing structures.
* Padding factor is typically 1.5x–2x.
* `| rest /services/data/indexes` shows **actual size on disk**.
* Cluster replication multiplies storage requirements.

---

If you want, I can make a **ready-to-use Splunk query** that calculates **estimated future storage needs** including padding and cluster replication automatically.

Do you want me to do that?
